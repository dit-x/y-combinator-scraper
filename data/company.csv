More than 3 million Americans are addicted to opioids, but 80% are not getting help, due to jobs, families, and privacy concerns. Meanwhile, there's a proven treatment that increases survival rates by 600%, and it's low cost, discreet, and convenient. It's called MAT, and it looks like treatment for anxiety or depression: medication plus therapy. However, doctors need a special waiver to prescribe the medication, which fewer than 5% of them have, so it's difficult to get, and most people are buying it on the street. Sadly, drug dealers aren't doctors: every 11 minutes another American dies of an opioid overdose, now the #1 cause of death for Americans under 50.

Ophelia is replacing rehab with telemedicine, using proven science and a consumer-first approach. The opioid treatment market in the U.S. is $15B, and 85% of opioid addicts have insurance that pays for it. We're treating roughly 400 patients with thousands more waiting.

The Human Utility's platform divides a bill similar to a loan syndicate expanding the possible number of donors from around the world able to join together to ensure families never lose access to utility service. Donors are matched with a specific family or donate to a universal assistance fund.

Later, we use utility data to design interventions addressing the root causes of why people need help with their utility bills with the goal of never having them lose service again."

My co-founder and I are Chemists with PhDs in Biomedical Engineering and we have an experienced leadership team already in place.
Insurance currently pays $770 per six-monthly treatment for knee osteoarthritis. With 5 million patients in the US, this represents a $7.7 Bn market opportunity.

India is a nation of savers but the way the majority of India saves is non-smart & does not create wealth. There are 200 Mn Indians who save manually in bank deposits, the returns from these instruments do not even beat India's inflation. 

Gold is an instrument that India loves - 30Bn worth gold is purchased in India every year by middle income households. Gold has great cultural significance in India & there is high familiarity with the asset class. Despite gold being a familiar asset class & giving 5% higher returns than bank deposits, 200 Mn Indians still save manually in these non wealth creating bank deposits. This is largely because the ways to save in Gold required painful discrete activities such as manually accumulating money to buy gold, going to offline stores to buy this gold, incurring storage charges & more. The minimum ticket size for purchasing gold at these stores is $50 adding to more friction to saving in Gold.

Using automated savings, Gullak now makes it extremely easy for users to save small amounts regularly($1/day) in digital Gold.This was not possible a year ago because the underlying infrastructure(UPI Autopay) was missing.

This isn't drones for burritos though, unless you want literally tons of burritos! We are addressing heavy payloads - the hardest stuff to fly electrically. 

Whether you’re in Antigua or Australia, Saipan or Sumatra, goods can take days or weeks to come by boat the cheap way. If you need pharmaceuticals, fresh produce, or electronics quickly, expect to pay 10x or 20x in shipping costs to have it flown. Electric aircraft could be a solution for lowering cost, but we’re stuck with small payloads and low range for many years to come. So for the hundreds of millions of people around the world in coastal or inter-island communities that could benefit the most, the electric aviation revolution just isn’t coming. Unless...

Without requiring FAA certification or integration into formal airspace, Seaflight’s simple uncrewed ""ground effect"" craft will enable high value, time-sensitive cargo to be flown overwater, point-to-point between coastal communities at 10x the speed of a ship, with triple the margin of conventional air freight, and almost double the range or payload of a conventional electric aircraft. Express air cargo continues to grow at double digit pace, it's time to deliver it in the most efficient way possible for cost and climate. 

*You won’t find impossible machines here*

1) We have prototype early flying hardware (at 25% scale) with autopilot for sustained low altitude flight, built and developed entirely in-house.
2) We’re actively working with the Coast Guard and branches of the armed forces to be able to safely test and develop our systems and operations in controlled ways, to reduce risk - but if the US moves slowly, we have an MoU for unrestricted testing in Europe. 
3) After that we’ll partner with an existing logistics operation to fly initial routes that are not heavily trafficked by ships, to build up our reliability and safety before scaling to other markets.

Notebook initially verifies users’ identifying information to ensure that each person has just a single Notebook. Neither Notebook, nor any other company knows the link between a user’s personal information and their Notebook. Once a user’s Notebook account is created they can begin proving their humanity and aggregating their credentials across wallets.

Notebook can be used to increase the safety of DeFi, governance, and airdrops. With Notebook, creators and communities can run Sybil-resistant airdrops, DAOs can verify the humanity and aggregate the credentials of participants, and lending protocols can build credit scoring systems to offer lower-collateralized loans.

In 2021, 79% of consumers worldwide reported already having at least one payment card saved with a service or being open to doing so. 

In recent years, card-issuing as-a-service has become mainstream: any company can now start their own card business in a matter of weeks. Last year, the number of new payment cards issued was at an all-time high. For users, however, switching banks or opening a new card now comes with an additional hurdle: they need to update their payment info across the internet. On the other side of that equation, card issuers have no visibility or control over the card-on-file updating process, and as a result struggle to get their new users to switch their spend from their old card to the new one, leading to low conversion rates and missed revenue opportunities.

Until Sunlight.

With our universal get-your-card-on-file API, FIs can now offer their users, at any point in their journey, a quick and easy way to update their debit/credit card info everywhere they shop or pay online, without ever leaving their Apps.

- Too many features that you’ll never use
- Too less features that you actually need
- Poor 3rd party integration options
- No transparency / black box system
- Just super expensive

Why Headless?

- With our headless product, the frontend is easy to customize for clients
- API-first approach makes it easy to connect with other existing systems or 3rd party services

- Reduced maintenance cost

Our initial data offering is focused on highly fragmented service industries such as medical, construction, restaurants, and hospitality. The data collected on these businesses includes firmographic, technographic, event, and individual background and contact data. Unlike static lead list providers, Ciro collects dynamic data into how prospects are changing day-to-day — such as, when a medical practice just canceled Zocdoc."

771,Cisterna Biologics,http://www.cisternabx.com,High quality mRNA for therapeutic application,2022,1,"San Diego, CA",USA,1,2,5,"Founded in 2022 and based in San Diego, California, Cisterna Biologics is a technology company. It aims to solve the main challenges currently facing the biotech industry to develop mRNA-based therapeutics – quality, quantity, longevity and cost of mRNA. As mRNA technology matures, it becomes imperative that these issues are solved so we can fully explore mRNA's endless possibilities as a therapeutic.

Cisterna uses proprietary technologies to either remove a contaminant at its source or replace the source itself. For example, to remove double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), we use ribozymes - molecular scissors - to precisely cut the mRNA at its 3’ end. This assures not only 3’ homogeneity, but also eliminates dsRNA, which are primarily produced due to self-templated additions at the 3’ end. Utilizing a PCR-like system to amplify the DNA template in large quantities eliminates the requirement for plasmid enrichment in bacteria, the prime source of endotoxin contamination. These are just a few examples of Cisterna’s powerful technologies being used to achieve our goal of 10x higher quality mRNA for therapeutic application.

Our overarching goal is to extend our platform technologies to express and purify mRNA directly from a eukaryotic host such as yeast. This would lead to a significant reduction in cost of mRNA manufacturing and potentially an even greater improvement in quality. There is accumulating evidence that naturally occurring mRNAs, with all the native folded structures and endogenous modifications, are better at expressing proteins without triggering innate immune responses compared to synthesized mRNAs - creating a more effective and accessible treatment for patients worldwide."

Soteri's patented pH/LOCK™ locks skin in at a therapeutic pH for 12+ hours, which is shown to help break the cycle of skin sensitivity, whether you have eczema, psoriasis, or just a bad sunburn.

Our formulations are aesthetically elegant (non-sticky, sit well under makeup, etc), safe for anyone to use, and don't require a prescription. Most people see skin health improvements within the first few weeks of application, even for tricky, chronic skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis.

With Soteri Skin, anyone can enjoy healthy, glowing, pH-enomenal skin!"

Today, all customer software is explicitly or implicitly designed for helping individuals, not teams. This is forcing B2B companies - who sell products to teams, not individuals - to augment their default customer support platform (Zendesk, Intercom, Front, etc) with a second, ""unofficial"", system: Slack's shared channels.

This causes a number of operational and logistical difficulties for both vendors and their customers, resulting in added costs, inefficiencies, and lost opportunities.

With Fogbender, B2B vendors embed a team-to-team messaging widget directly on their customer dashboard, where all users belonging to an account can - with no additional authentication - 1) see a list of currently-open issues 2) participate in conversations with their own team and the vendor, and 3) search all historical discussions."

On average, store owners buy products from over 10-15 different suppliers each week. This painful process involves shopping in massive warehouses or spending hours working with wholesaler’s sales representatives (who sometimes don’t even show up). As a result, stores waste countless hours ordering products through extremely inefficient and tedious processes. These store owners are also severely impacted by inventory shortages and revenue loss which many times results in them downsizing their business or shutting them down completely.

Attain solves this problem by providing a single app to purchase products across all of their suppliers, resulting in a one-stop shop for inventory. By aggregating inventory across a multitude of suppliers and wholesalers, Attain helps stores save significant time and money while allowing them to focus on what they do best - growing their businesses.
